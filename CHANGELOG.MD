## v1.0.3 project maintenance
Added this changelog, made the readme more relevant.
Added apache license to the project.

## v1.0.2 tile-content placement
Fixes a major annoyance with how the .tile-content
is place inside of the tile. It's edges are now
flush with the .tile's as it should be.
This allows for more styling of the .tile-content
without adding more markup.

## v1.0.1 collapse
Added .collapse utility tag to tiles.
This "Fixes" a hopefully rare "bug" when nesting rows
in tiles but the row content doesn't equal the tile
in height, creating whitespace.

## v1.0.0 Public release
